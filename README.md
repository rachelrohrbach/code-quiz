## General info
This project is a timed quiz that tests the user's code-related knowledge. It consists of 5 total questions and gives the user a total of 75 seconds to answer the 5 questions giving them 15 seconds for each, however if the incorrect answer is selected 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. The users score is the time remaining once they get to the last question or if the timer gets to 0. The user inputs their initials to save their score locally on a highscore list with up to 10 of the highest scores. The highscore list can also be cleared via clearing the local storage. I put the questions in a separate javascript file which allows for additional questions to be added to the quiz if desired.

# Credits
I consulted jQuery API Documentation (https://api.jquery.com/), W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) extensively in creating my project. Some other resources that I used include: Stack Overflow (#https://stackoverflow.com/) and the GitLab repository for my course, specifically referencing the in-class activities.
